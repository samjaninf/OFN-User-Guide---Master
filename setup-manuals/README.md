# Setup Manuals

The Harvest To Order works as both a directory of local food enterprises and an ecommerce software that you can use to sell online.

The Harvest To Order is flexible and can be used by different people in different ways.

We have put together unique setup manuals which provide specific setup guidance depending on who you are and how you want to use the Harvest To Order. Have a look at our setup manuals to find the one that's right for you.
