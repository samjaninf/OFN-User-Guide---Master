# Hub

## What is a hub profile?

* It's a place to tell your story to people who are interested in local food enterprises and organisations.
* You'll be visible on the OFN map.
* If you ever want to take sales online, you can add the shopfront functionality to your profile.

## What does it do?

**Makes you visible**  
When you have a profile on the Open Food Network, you become visible in your local food movement. You become contactable to customers who want to shop with you. You also become reachable to other enterprises who may want to supply to you, collaborate or distribute with you.

## Steps for setting up a Producer Profile

1\) [Register your profile](/Register-and-create-your-profile.md) on Open Food Network. This setup tool will ask for basic information about your enterprise to create your profile. You'll be prompted to confirm your email address.

2\) Select the 'hub profile' [package type](/package-types.md).

#### **Your basic profile is now complete!**

**If you want to edit your profile, or add further detail you can**

3\) modify your [enterprise settings](/Enterprise-settings.md).

#### Well done, you're set up!

You will now have a space to tell the story of your enterprise and to help drive connections to your social and online presence.
