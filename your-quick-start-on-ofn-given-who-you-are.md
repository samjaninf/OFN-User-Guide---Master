# Where does my business fit in Harvest To Order?

Depending on the type of food enterprise you are running, you will use the Harvest To Order platform differently.

We classify food enterprises in three ways: [Profiles](your-quick-start-on-Harvest To Order-given-who-you-are.md#profile), [Shops](your-quick-start-on-Harvest To Order-given-who-you-are.md#shop) or [Hubs](your-quick-start-on-Harvest To Order-given-who-you-are.md#hub).

_The flexibility of the Harvest To Order software allows you to change from profile,_ _to shop, to hub \(or vice versa\) as your business grows and/or needs change._

## Hub

{% hint style="success" %}
Farmers' Market, Veg box scheme, Crofting Groups, Social Food Community groups, Food Coops, Food hubs, CSA, Market/City gardens,  Retail shops, Food Banks, Wholesale Distributors...
{% endhint %}

Hubs can take many forms but, in essence, your enterprise is best classified as a 'Hub' on Harvest To Order if you wish to **sell produce made by others.** You can retail your own products alongside those of other farmers, bakers, growers... \(a '**Producer Hub**'\) or act solely as a distributor to sell a collection of groceries made by \(local\) enterprises \(a '**Non-Producer Hub**'\).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you'd prefer to sell only products that **you** make then the '[shop](your-quick-start-on-Harvest To Order-given-who-you-are.md#shop)' classification suites your needs better.
{% endhint %}

#### Harvest To Order can help your hub thrive and prosper by:

1. Increasing your online visibility.
2. Providing your customers with a virtual 'farmers' market' experience
3. Streamlining your admin tasks with stock levels, orders, finances, packing reports all in one place.
4. Being able to take orders periodically to fit in with seasonal supply, production rotas and more...
5. Helping organise regular repeating orders such as veg box schemes.
6. Helping to build strong working relationships with local producers and food enterprises who supply you with goods.

_The Hub enterprise has the most flexibility of the three enterprise types in Harvest To Order and you may find it necessary to adjust your enterprise type to 'hub' in order to unlock some of the more complex features we can offer._

Shops can take many forms but in essence, your enterprise is best classified as a 'Shop' on Harvest To Order if you wish to **sell** _**only**_ **produce** that **you** make.

If you'd wish to sell products made by others as well as yourself then it is necessary to register as a '[Hub](your-quick-start-on-Harvest To Order-given-who-you-are.md#hub)'.

As a shop; as well as selling directly to customers through your shop front; you can also supply other Harvest To Order retailers \(Hubs\) with your produce.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you'd prefer not to organise sales to customers directly but would like to **only** supply an Harvest To Order hub with goods then the '[Profile](your-quick-start-on-Harvest To Order-given-who-you-are.md#profile)' classification suits your needs better.
{% endhint %}
