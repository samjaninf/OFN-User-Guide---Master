# Shopfront

To open your online shop on Harvest To Order and start selling, your enterprise must be registered as either a Producer Shop or Producer/Non-Producer Hub.  Read more about the different Enterprise profiles[ here](../../your-quick-start-on-Harvest To Order-given-who-you-are.md) and [here](../enterprise-profile/).

The next essential steps are to set up [Shipping](shipping-methods.md) and [Payment](payment-methods.md) Methods for your enterprise.  At this stage we also suggest creating [Enterprise Fees](enterprise-fees.md) \(a mark up added to the price each product charged by the supplying producer to cover admin and distribution costs\).

Opening and closing times of shop fronts on Harvest To Order, as well as the option to sub-select products for different dates and times of collection, are controlled by [Order Cycles](order-cycle/).
