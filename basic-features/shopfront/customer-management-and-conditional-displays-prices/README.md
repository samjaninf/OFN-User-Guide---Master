# Customer management and conditional displays/prices

Often an enterprise may want to offer individual customers and wholesale retailers different prices \(or even different products- such as bulk buys\).

For some enterprises \(such as community food groups\) 'members' may be eligible to reduced rates in comparison to 'non members'.

'[**Tags and Tag rules**](tags-and-tag-rules.md)' are the mechanism on the OFN platform whereby differential pricing and other benefits can be imparted to specific customer groups, if desired.
