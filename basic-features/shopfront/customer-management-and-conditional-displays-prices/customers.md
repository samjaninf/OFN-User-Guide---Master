# Customer Management

A list of all customers who have placed an order with your enterprise can be viewed from the Customers menu in the admin dashboard.

You can also manually add a customer by the **+New Customer** button.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only people who are in your customer list can be assigned a Tag and hence be assigned to a category.  
_Hence if you have a_ [_private shop_](../private-shopfront.md) _front you will have to manually add all new customers and assign them the correct tag before they can shop._
{% endhint %}

## Customer Billing and Shipping Address

Each customer can have a default billing and shipping address.  If a customer has a registered OFN account and has completed their details fully their addresses will be copied to this section automatically.  
Storing a default billing and shipping address can make online purchases quicker for the customer.

## Tags \(to group customers in to categories\)

You can assign your customers to groups and then offer [group-specific pricing and/or product listings](tags-and-tag-rules.md).

On the OFN platform this is achieved by assigning all customers belonging to a common group \(ie all your wholesale customers\) the same tag.  
To add a tag, simply type its name in the 'Tags' column on the Customers page. A customer can have several tags and of course the same tag can be linked to several people. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Careful when you are adding the same tag to multiple customers \(so that they belong to a common group\) to select the identical word \(tags are case sensitive\) from the drop down menu on offer.
{% endhint %}

Tags also appear in [reports](../../reports.md). You can use them during csv / excel exports to quickly filter data.
