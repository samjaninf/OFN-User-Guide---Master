# Subscriptions

{% hint style="info" %}
Subscriptions is in 'beta' mode, meaning it's a new feature that may still have some glitches. Please [contact us](https://www.openfoodnetwork.org/find-your-local-open-food-network/) with any feedback about what works, what needs improving or how it could be better explained.

## What are subscriptions? <a id="what-are-subscriptions"></a>

Subscriptions are recurring or standing orders that can be set up for the customers of any Enterprise with a shopfront. Once set up, these orders will be automatically processed at defined intervals \(eg. weekly, fortnightly, monthly\).

{% hint style="success" %}
Subscriptions are convenient for customers, as they can know that their order will be processed without needing to remember to place their order. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Subscriptions are also a good way for an Enterprise to boost customer loyalty and make their order volumes more predictable.

**Features of Subscriptions**

* Customers can choose to have their 'usual order' placed automatically.
* Customers can set up an automatic credit card payment \(using [Stripe](../shopfront/payment-methods.md#integrated-payment-providers)\) for their subscription
* Enterprises and/or customers can pause, cancel and/or add/remove products from their standard subscription order.
