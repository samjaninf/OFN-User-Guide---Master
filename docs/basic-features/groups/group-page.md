# Create and manage a Group page

**What is a group page?** Group pages are a way for a collection of businesses which exist in the real world to have their own customisable directory on Harvest To Order. Group pages are suited to:

* regional producer groups
* enterprises with a common certification
* farmer's markets
* large multi-hub enterprises.

Any collection of enterprises on the Harvest To Order can create a group page. 

**What does a group page look like?** You can see some [Group Pages on Harvest To Order Australia](https://harvesttoorder.com/groups).

**How can I create a group page?** To create and manage a group, you’ll need to [contact your local Harvest To Order ](https://www.harvesttoorder.com/find-your-local-open-food-network/)so we can set you up as an administrator.

## Managing a Group Page

Once you’ve been set up as the administrator of a group, you’ll be able to view and edit your group by clicking on **Groups** in the horizontal blue menu. Then click on the **edit** icon next to your group.
