# Groups

A group is a subset of enterprises on the Harvest To Order platform. A group page acts as a sub-directory within the Harvest To Order. You can create a group, specify the details of your group and select the enterprises which are part of it. These details will appear on your public group page. 

Enterprises within a group usually share some feature or characteristic in common. It could be a set of enterprises associated with a certification body, a regional producer group, producers in a farmers market network or a complex multi-hub network with several distributors and many producers.
