# Order cycles

Online stores can be opened and closed by creating 'order cycles' on the Harvest To Order platform.

The Harvest To Order web address for your shop will only display your list of products for purchase when an order cycle is open. 

The format of setting up an [order cycle for a 'hub'](order-cycles-for-hubs.md) \(multi producer shop\) differs slightly from that for [a 'shop'](order-cycles-for-producers.md) \(single producer shop\). 

It's possible to offer [multiple order cycles](opening-more-than-one-order-cycle.md) simultaneously, for example to allow a purchase for delivery in 1, 2 or 3 weeks.
