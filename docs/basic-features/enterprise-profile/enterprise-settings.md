### Address

This information is used to geolocate your enterprise the Harvest To Order map. Your exact address won't show if you are only registered as a Producer or Non-Producer Profile.  However if you are registered as a Shop or Hub your address will show in text form in your shop front's contact details tab.

### Properties 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Visible to **Producers** only
{% endhint %}

You can add properties \(such as free range or certified organic\) to your enterprise. These properties will then be automatically applied to **all** of your products. 

You can also specify properties for particular products only. This is useful if you stock both certified organic and ordinary groceries, for example. More information about this can be found [here](../products-1/product-properties.md). 

### Shipping Methods, Payment Methods & Enterprise Fees

{% hint style="warning" %}
Visible to Shops or Hubs registered enterprises only \(ie invisible for Producer/Non-Producer Profiles\)
{% endhint %}

The [Shipping Methods](../shopfront/shipping-methods.md), [Payment Methods](../shopfront/payment-methods.md) and [Enterprise Fees](../shopfront/enterprise-fees.md) are covered in greater detail in later chapters in this user manual.

{% hint style="danger" %}
At least one method of **payment** and **delivery** must be setup to be able to open your online shopfront.
{% endhint %}

### Inventory Settings

{% hint style="warning" %}
Visible to Shop and Hub registered enterprises only.
{% endhint %}

For most enterprises the recommended setting can be used.

Advanced users who need greater flexibility with product management should consult the [Inventory](../products-1/inventory-tool.md) page of this guide before changing the settings.

### Tag Rules

{% hint style="warning" %}
Visible to Shop and Hub registered enterprises only.
{% endhint %}

Under this menu are all the 'tags' which have been assigned to the customers of your enterprise.

'Tags' are labels you apply to customers, products and other settings to assign differential access, pricing or other benefits to specific groups.  They are particularly useful if you wish to charge loyal customers or 'members' of your food hub preferential prices or allow them to pay by BACS rather than PayPal/Stripe.

 For more information, visit the ['customer management and conditional displays/prices' section](../shopfront/customer-management-and-conditional-displays-prices/).

### Shop Preferences

{% hint style="warning" %}
Visible to Shop and Hub registered enterprises only.
{% endhint %}

**Shopfront Message**: This message is optional. It will be displayed at the top of your online store, above the product listings. It’s an opportunity to provide basic information to the customer about how your store works. For example, you may explain how your order cycles are structured, or any membership requirements. It could also be a friendly greeting, or a chance to promote specials. An example is below:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/shopfront-message.png)

**Shopfront Closed Message**: This message will be displayed when your shopfront is closed \(no active order cycle\). It’s a chance to tell customers about how your ordering works, and when the shop will next be open and accepting orders.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/store-closed.png)

**Shopfront Category Ordering**: By default, products are arranged alphabetically in your shop. You can choose to display the products in order of category according to your wish. In this case, the products will be displayed in order of category and then in alphabetical order within their category. E.g. you may wish to have your Meat & Fish products to appear at the top, with your less important Pickles & Preserves appearing further down the shopfront.

**Sort order cycles on shopfront by:** If your shopfront has [more than one order cycle open at the same time](../shopfront/order-cycle/opening-more-than-one-order-cycle.md) you can select the order in which they appear on the shopfront. You may opt to sort them by closing date \(closing soonest first\) or by opening date \(opening soonest first\).

**Publicly visible shopfront?** If you select ‘public’, any shopper will be able to access your shopfront and place an order. If you select ‘visible to registered customers only’, shoppers who come to your shop will be prompted to login and only those users who are on your customers list will be given access to your shop. Learn more about the [private shop feature](../shopfront/private-shopfront.md).

**Guest Orders?** If you select ‘allow guest checkout’ shoppers won’t need to login to the Harvest To Order to shop with you, so they don't need to sign up and have a user account. If you want the extra security of knowing your customers must have an Harvest To Order account in order to have placed an order then select "require login to order". 

In order for a customer to have an Harvest To Order account they must have confirmed the email sent to them when registering with us.  Thus, by selected "require login to order" it may help limit the number of orders placed that are subsequently never collected as you know that the customer's order confirmation email will be sent to an active email account.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The 'Guest orders' setting is not applicable if you have opted for 'visible to registered customers only'.
{% endhint %}

This user will have an envelope symbol next to their name in the managers' field.

**Managers:** Other Harvest To Order users who have been granted permission to manage this account. Want to add a new manager? You can search for existing emails of users who have registered for an Harvest To Order account and add them as managers. If you don't find any user for the email you are looking for, the user doesn't exist yet on the Harvest To Order, you need to invite them \(see next point\).

**Invite manager:** This is for adding a manager who is not registered with Harvest To Order. When you add them, they'll be sent an email confirmation and when they confirm their email they'll be able to set a password, and login to administer this enterprise.
