# Enterprise profile

Once you have [created your Enterprise account](../register-and-create-your-profile.md#create-your-first-enterprise-account), you must log in to your Administration [Dashboard](../dashboard.md) to continue setting up your Enterprise profile. 

First you will be asked to [choose the Harvest To Order package](package-types.md) \(or type of profile\) which best represents your [business model](../../your-quick-start-on-Harvest To Order-given-who-you-are.md). 

In this section we detail the different menus that you can complete to refine your enterprise profile and, by doing so, access business-specific features that you may need.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is important to complete the whole process otherwise your enterprise might not appear on the map, or appear with a partially filled in profile, which can affect your image.
{% endhint %}
