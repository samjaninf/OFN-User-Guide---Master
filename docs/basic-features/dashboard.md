# Dashboard

The Dashboard ****is where you can edit and manage your enterprise's features & settings on the Harvest To Order platform. If you have chosen to register your enterprise as a [shop](../your-quick-start-on-Harvest To Order-given-who-you-are.md#shop) or [hub](../your-quick-start-on-Harvest To Order-given-who-you-are.md#hub) then you can also edit your products and order cycles from the Dashboard. 

Access your dashboard from the homepage by first logging in and then clicking on the Profile Icon in the top right hand corner, and selecting **Administration** from the drop-down menu.

The options you will see on your dashboard will depend on which enterprise type you choose on [registration](register-and-create-your-profile.md). The screenshots below show the dashboard view for different types of users.
