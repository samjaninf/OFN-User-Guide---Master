# Create orders manually

Sometimes you may wish to manually put an order into the system. This may be on behalf of a customer, or so that your reports will capture an order from a different sales stream. You can create an order by going to **Orders** and clicking on the **+ New Order** button.

Firstly you will be prompted to select the distributor that the order will be placed with.   
Next you will need to select the order cycle that you want the order to be placed in. You choice of order cycle will dictate which products will be available to be added into the order and the fees applied.  
You will then be redirected to the following page where you can select products. You must type at least the first 3 characters of the product for it to appear as an option in the drop down list:

After editing any aspect of the cart, click **update and recalculate fees** to update the price.

The next step is to add in the customer’s details \(right hand menu, second option down\). If it is a customer who is on your customer list, you can select them from the dropdown menu, otherwise you can fill in the customer’s details details and check them out as a guest.
