# Orders

Once your shop is online \(ie you have an active [Order Cycle](../shopfront/order-cycle/)\) , customers are able to place orders. This section explains how to: 

* [manage and modify orders](view-orders.md)
* [create orders manually for customers](create-orders-manually.md)
* [adjust payments](refund-payments.md) \(refunds etc\)
* print [receipts](thermally-printed-receipts.md).
