### Our model and what's in it for you?
%accordion%Why choose Harvest To Order? What's the difference with other online stores?%accordion%

We think the Harvest To Order is pretty great, and unique to other options out there!

* **Networked-**
  The Harvest To Order differs from private online shops in that they can be networked with other enterprises. Producers have the option of selling through their own, independently run store, but they can also choose to sell through another enterprise. Food hubs stock the produce of multiple producers and offer them more exposure and greater market access than they can achieve on their own.
* **Exposure-**
  The Harvest To Order has a directory functionality, so customers landing on our homepage may be driven to your store if your offerings match their search terms, or if you’re located close by to them. The Harvest To Order is a centralised place for people looking to access great, local produce, giving participating producers exposure to a wider customer base.
* **Food enterprise specific-**
  The Harvest To Order’s shopfront capabilities are also designed especially for food enterprises, so it saves you from having to develop your own software from scratch \(which can be a lengthy and costly process, trust us!\).
* **Flexible-**
  The Harvest To Order is flexible in accommodating all kinds of shipping/collection and payment methods. Some online store offerings for producers are restricted in the kinds of shipping and payment methods that can be accepted \(for example, limited strictly to postage\).
* **Room to grow-**
  Producers can start with a profile, and easily build up to start selling to others, opening their own online store and becoming a supplier to multiple enterprises. Once you have a profile, you can easily open your own store, and link with other stores, something that most software options cannot offer.
* **We have soul**
  – The Harvest To Order is a social enterprise, which is owned by all of us. It’s non-profit and continuously working to facilitate improvements to our food system. All revenues are reinvested back into the software, so it can be more useful to more people. So you can feel great about being part of the Harvest To Order!

%accordion%How can producers make use of the Harvest To Order?%accordion%

The Harvest To Order can help producers access a greater diversity of markets. This can be through direct sales, or through intermediary hubs or retailers, who perform the sales and logistics functions. The Harvest To Order enables transparency in the supply chain. Because all food traded on the Harvest To Order must be linked to the farmer who produced it, customers can see where their food originated from and how it was produced. In Harvest To Order shopfronts, the pricing is also transparent, so customers can see what cut of the sale price went to the producer. Our ultimate goal is fair price to farmers and affordable, good food for eaters.

### Is the Harvest To Order suitable for you?
%accordion%I'm a producer and I would like to start selling directly to customers.%accordion%

Producers can create a professional and affordable online shop on the Harvest To Order, and begin trading direct with customers. An online store is simple to set up, taking just a few hours \(check out theset-up guidefeature list\). As well as the shopfront, an online shop also comes with handy tools which streamline the administration side of operating an online store. Click here for a full.

%accordion%I'm a producer and I want to sell my products through a hub.%accordion%

The Harvest To Order aims to facilitate producers and hubs working together and forming networks of food movement and trade. We encourage producers to search for hubs in their area \(on the Harvest To Order map\) who could be compatible trading partners \(check out their profiles\). However, the Harvest To Order doesn’t play an active role in partnering producers and hubs.

To supply a hub, the producer must have a profile on the Harvest To Order and add their products to that profile. They must also make contact with the hub they wish to supply to discuss the agreement. If the hub is willing to stock the products, you can grant the hub permission to stock your products in the Harvest To Order E2E permissions. The hub can then add your products to their Harvest To Order shop front and start selling them!

%accordion%I sell through farmers markets and want an online store in addition to this.%accordion%

An Harvest To Order online store is a good addition for producers who are already doing direct sales through farmer’s markets. The online store enables customers to order in advance, for a quick pick up at the market, and to access your products outside of market times. Some producers also find that the online store is preferable for hospitality customers who cannot attend markets.

%accordion%Our farmer's market considers an online platform , to allow customers to shop from our producers outside of market day.%accordion%

There are a number of potential paths you could take:

1. Each farmer within the farmers market can establish their own profile and online shop on the Harvest To Order. The farmers market’s website could then promote links to these independently run shops.
2. The farmer’s markets could create a
   **group page**
   on the Harvest To Order. This is an umbrella profile, which can house the profiles and stores of member producers. With a unique URL and landing page, this group site allows for collective marketing and promotions.
3. Farmer’s market groups who are willing to cooperate and work together can establish a hub. This hub has a single shopfront offering the entire product range of participating producers. Finding a way to coordinate the logistics of incoming and outgoing products can require some creative thinking, but using the farmer’s market days as a chance to aggregate and pack orders is one simple option.

%accordion%I already sell my products to customers via an online shop, how can I get involved with the Harvest To Order?%accordion%

%accordion%We have infrequent and unpredictable surplus stock which we'd like to sell.%accordion%

Producers with an Harvest To Order profile can add products, which hubs can then sell through their Harvest To Order shopfronts. If you have irregular surplus stock, you can talk to hubs to arrange for them to stock your produce when you have it on hand.

The reporting functionality of the Harvest To Order makes the administration tasks of running a store straightforward, by helping you to track orders, payment and inventory. You can easily view reports summarising the total orders, individual orders and the payment status of each order.

###Creating a producer account
%accordion%What is the difference between a profile and a shopfront on the Harvest To Order?%accordion%

The Harvest To Order functions as a directory, advertising platform, and an online marketplace. People can choose which functionalities of the Harvest To Order they want to use, according to their needs.

1. A Profile.

A profile on the Harvest To Order is the simplest option, and offers a way for producers to market themselves. The profile can be used to promote your products and services, share your story and provide contact details. A profile makes you visible and contactable to customers and other enterprises who might wish to trade with you. Producers with a profile can also add products, which hub enterprises can then stock in their stores.

1. A Shopfront

An Harvest To Order shop, is like a profile, but it also includes all the functions needed for producers to sell directly to customers online. This includes the online shopfront with full checkout capabilities as well as behind the scenes tools to aid in administration, such as reporting of payments and inventory. The Harvest To Order is a network, so it allows shops to be connected with other shops. This way a producer can be stocking their products in their own independent store, as well as through a number of hub shops.

%accordion%How do I control the order of products displayed in my shopfront?%accordion%

Yes, you can select the order that each category of food is displayed in your shop, then within each category the products are displayed alphabetically. For instance, if Meat and Fish are your most important products, you can select to have them show up first, with your secondary Oil and Spreads products below. You can do this in  your profile settings, under‘shopfront category ordering’.

%/accordion%

%accordion%Why can't I see all of my products in my shopfront?%accordion%

Here’s a few things to check:

* Has the product been added to the order cycle? Open the order cycle and double check that all tick boxes next to your products have been selected.
* Is there enough ‘on hand’ inventory? If the ‘on hand’ inventory value is zero for a product, then it will no longer appear in your store. If you have products which are always ‘on hand’, you can check the ‘on demand’ box corresponding to that product- then it will never be out of stock.
* Is the product on your
  Inventory Hidden
  list?

%accordion%I only want existing customers to see and to shop in my shop, can I make it 'member only'?%accordion%

Yes, you can restrict access to your shop to approved customers only. Checkout instructionshere.

%/accordion%


%accordion%How can I tell my customers about how my shop works and the terms and conditions?%accordion%

There is the option of adding a ‘shopfront message’ to your shop. This message is clearly visible to customers when they visit your shop and you can add as much or as little detail here as you like. Instructions for inserting a ‘shopfront message’ can be found here.

%accordion%Can I set a minimum spend amount in my shopfront?%accordion%

Harvest To Order doesn’t currently have the option of blocking checkout until a customer’s order reaches a defined threshold. An alternative option is to add a shipping fee with the ‘price sac’ fee calculator. This calculator will apply one fee value if the total is below a given level, and another fee value \(possibly $0\) if the order is over that level.See here.

%/accordion%

%accordion%Why doesn't my profile show up when I filter for producers of meat on the producer listing page?%accordion%

The filter tool on theproducer listing pagehere, allows customers to search for producers of certain product categories \(ie Fruit, or Meat\). The filter tool works by looking at the products that are assigned to each producer’s profile. If a producer has an online shop, their products will already be in the system. But if you only have a profile, this filter tool won’t capture you, until you add some dummy products. Instructions for doing this can be found. Once you have dummy products set up for the product categories that you produce, you’ll be captured by this filter tool.

###Delivery and payment

%accordion%How do payments work?%accordion%

An online store allows producers to sell their produce to customers and collect payment via a number of options. The Harvest To Order doesn’t dictate a payment method, and you can use any arrangement that works for you. Current payment options which are integrated into the checkout process include Paypal, Pin Payments and EFTPOS \(through a payment gateway\). Enterprises can also use manual methods including invoicing, cash on collection and direct deposit.
