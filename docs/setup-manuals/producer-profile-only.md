## What does it do?

**Makes you visible**  
When you have a profile on the Harvest To Order, you become visible in your local food movement. You become contactable to customers who want to access your products. And you become reachable to other enterprises who may want to collaborate or distribute with you.

**Lets you supply other shops**  
If you want to supply a shop on the Harvest To Order, you can create your profile, and then upload your product range. The shop you supply can then see your products and add them to their Harvest To Order online shopfront.
