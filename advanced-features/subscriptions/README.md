## What are subscriptions? {#what-are-subscriptions}

Subscriptions is a tool which lets shops setup recurring or standing orders for their customers. Once setup, these orders will be automatically processed at defined intervals. The feature is convenient for customers, as they can know that their order will be processed without needing to remember to place their order. Subscriptions are also a good way for shops to boost customer loyalty and make their order volumes more predictable.

Here are the basics of Subscriptions:

* Customers can opt to have an recurring order which contains defined products and repeats periodically.
* Enterprises can give their customers the chance to pause, cancel and add/remove products from their subscriptions.
* Customers can grant the shop permission to automatically bill their credit card for their subscription using the Stripe payment method.

## Steps to set up subscriptions {#steps-to-set-up-subscriptions}

We've described the subscription setup process in 9 steps across three pages in the user guide.

Firstly, the [subscriptions - configuration](subscriptions-configuration.md) page describes how to configure your shop to enable the subscription feature, and some things to do to prepare.

1\) [Enable Subscriptions](subscriptions-configuration.md#1-enable-subscriptions) in your Enterprise Settings.

2\) Setup [Schedules](subscriptions-configuration.md#2-schedules), which will dictate how frequently subscriptions are processed.

3\) [Gather information from your customers](subscriptions-configuration.md#3-gather-information-from-your-customers), including their contact detail, which items they'd like in their subscription and which shipping and payment methods they'll use.

4\) [Add your subscription customers to your Customers list](subscriptions-configuration.md#4-add-your-subscribers-to-your-customer-list), and then ask them to signup to OFN.
